# rock-paper-scissor-sim
I was curious to see if one item was better in this simulation game. 

## Findings
I ran this experiment first 100k times, and then a million. In both cases, rock appears to have won every so slightly more than paper or scissors. However, the discrepancy seems to have lessened over a higher simulation count. Therefore, I think it would be reasonable to expect this trend to continue. I will run this for a further 10 million times, (roughly equivalent to 10 hours runtime for my computer) and check the results then.
